                        This application was developed for <a href="https://grape.ics.uci.edu/wiki/public/wiki/cs122b-2017-spring" target="_blank" class="link-no-bold">CS 122B</a>, a project course in web applications and databases at UCI. My partner Eric Vu and I developed it over a period of 10 weeks. Unfortunately we no longer have credit for AWS, so I could not provide pictures or our version of the project. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Afterthought</h5>
                    <p>
                        Developing this web application was difficult due to the course being 10 weeks long since UCI runs on a quarter system. Having to learn a bunch of new technologies to us, such as AWS and Tomcat, along with learning how to connect the back-end to the front-end made it a very fast-paced and challenging course. Due to this, I remember our front-end of the website being very barebones, because most of our grade would be based on the usability and correctness of the functionality. Despite the challenge, I enjoyed the course because it gave me a little bit of experience with developing a full stack application.
