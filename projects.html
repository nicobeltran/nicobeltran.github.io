				<p> Othello is a popular strategy board game. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. </p>

				<h2> Fabflix </h2>

				<p> Unfortunately, I did not take any pictures of the project, so this section is a wall of text at the moment. </p>

				<p> Fabflix is an e-commerce website centered around selling DVDs of movies. It contains a search bar in order to search for movies, as well as sorting options by title, release date, genre, actors, etc. It also contains information about the actors in a movie, and information about the actors themselves. Once a user has decided on purchasing movies, they can add the movies to a cart. This cart can be updated and once the user enters credit card information, it is checked against a database containing credit cards for validation. The website also came with HTTPS security, reCaptcha, and even a mobile application.</p>

				<p> The database containing all the data was created and controlled using MySQL. The website ran on a Tomcat server using AWS, and was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Javascript was used to edit information stored in the database and obtain data from it as well. The mobile application was created using the Android Studio and could be used to search for movies. </p>

					<figcaption> Bio section of webpage </figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p> A webpage to advertise a "family" for a campus organization, Circle K. Circle K has many different families which function as separate groups within the club in order to aid in forming closer relations between its members. This webpage served to promote the Shark family and give information about the bigs who were in charge of the family. </p>

				<p> The page is coded in HTML. Pictures and graphics were designed by myself as well. </p>

Mobile-device friendly. Uses smooth scrolling to scroll to different projects.  </p>
