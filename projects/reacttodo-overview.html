            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>
                I made this project after finishing the React portion of Stephen Grider's Modern React course on Udemy. I decided to practice
                what I learned right after, in order to hopefully cement the fundamentals of React.
            </p>
            <h5>Afterthought</h5>
            <p>
                At the start, I thought creating this project would be rather simple. I knew I wanted to split it into four components: a
                form for input, the list, each list item, and the containing component. Figuring out what to make into components
                and creating them did not take much effort, however, I was stumped on state and how to pass props around
                the components. I eventually figured out I needed to pass data from the input up to the containing "app"
                component to set a state, then pass those props down into the list and list item components.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developing this project has given me a better understanding of state and handling props. It has bettered my understanding
                of flow of data as well. I think I definitely need more practice with that concept because I feel like that
                is what will really separate good React developers from great ones.
