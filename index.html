					<h1> About Me </h1>
					<p> Hi, I'm Nico Beltran, a current 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California, Irvine majoring in Computer Science and specializing in Information. Although most of my coursework and background at UCI involved programming and software development, I am also heavily interested in front-end development, UX design and accessibility. I have a fascination with aesthetically pleasing interfaces and the design and thought that goes into them. </p>

					<p>At UCI, I was involved with an international community service organization, Circle K International. I helped plan various fundraisers and events for the club, some of my favorite being Change Thru Games, a 24 hour streamed video game marathon which raised money for the Kiwanis Family House through donations and dares, as well as Family Day, which is an event in which the club bonds over games and challenges. </p>

					<p>I am also a member of Modern Completely Insane Anteaters (MCIA), an exhibition urban dance team on campus. We perform at various on-campus and off-campus events as well as various fundraisers.</p>

					<p> Besides computer science and campus related things, I have a variety of different hobbies. I play videogames relatively often, and I usually default to a few games of League of Legends or PUBG. I also enjoy dancing and freestyling in spare time. As of recently, I've had a lot of fun trying to learn how to cook as well.</p>
