				<h1> User Research </h1>

					<li> <h3> User Interviews </h3>
						<figure><img class="portfolio" src="https://i.imgur.com/0btRKb5.png" alt="picture of user interviews"></figure>
						
						<p>User interviews are important because it helped me figure out what kind of material would be crucial to add to my portfolio. It also gave me some ideas of which features to prioritize.  Besides asking what types of material would look good on a portfolio, I also asked questions about my interviewee's occupation to get more background on their answers and where they come from.

					<li> <h3> Competitor Analysis </h3>
						<figure><img class="portfolio" src="./img/competitor_analysis" alt="competitor_analysis.png"></figure>
						
						<p> A competitor analysis is quite as the name implies; analysis competitors. In this case, my competitors are people in a similar field that I am trying to land a position in. Most of the competitors I analyzed, however, seem to be people with years of experience in the field. In retrospect, I should've searched for more undergraduate student portfolios to analyze instead.

					<li> <h3> Feature Value Matrix </h3>
						<figure><img class="portfolio" src="./img/featurevaluematrix" alt="featurevaluematrix.png"></figure>
						
						<p> A feature value matrix is a research technique to determine which features are more valuable to implement than others. This takes into account the development effort, business value, and user value. The features I chose to put into my portfolio mostly came from user interviews and competitor analysis, with a few being some that I already knew I wanted to implement from the start.

					</li>

					<li> <h3> Feature Prioritization </h3>
						<figure><img class="portfolio" src="./img/feature_prioritization" alt="feature_prioritization.png"></figure>
						
						<p> The prioritization of my features stems directly from the feature value matrix. Whatever I gathered from interviews and competitor analysis, I took into consideration when prioritizing features. When building my portfolio's interface, I took into account which features were priority, and made sure to build/include those first if possible.

				<h1> User Testing </h1>

				<ul>
					<li> <h3> User Stories </h3>
							<figure><img class="portfolio" src="./img/user_stories" alt="feature_prioritization.png"></figure>
							
							<p> User stories are important because they are short scenarios which a user might be going through when using my portfolio. Most of these originated by taking into account what features I had and if these features could be easily accessed successfully. 
							<br>

					</li>

					<li> <h3> Cognitive Walkthrough </h3>
							<figure><img class="portfolio" src="./img/user_stories" alt="feature_prioritization.png"></figure>
							
							<p> A cognitive walkthrough is walking a tester through features of your website by asking questions. They will explain their thought process as to why and how they interact with certain parts of the interface to succeed in the task asked of them by the interviewer. A challenge I faced during these is coming up with questions which would give me information about what may be wrong with my interface. Another challenge is coming up with questions that would make my testers actually speak their thoughts while doing the walkthrough.

					</li>

					<li> <h3> User Tests </h3>
							<figure><img class="portfolio" src="./img/user_tests" alt="user_tests.png"></figure>
							
							<p> I decided to do testing on my landing page to see if users could tell what the website was for on arrival. I also checked to see if they knew where to click when searching from skills on the landing page. I also tested if the navigation bar was clear and users could use it to get to my about me page. The biggest challenge was figuring out what to test because some things might seem obvious for the developer but not so obvious for users.

					<h1> Summary of Findings </h1>
					<p> From my cognitive walkthrough, I found that general navigation of my website is pretty easy. However, there are areas the user might navigate incorrectly. For example, one of my testers said that they believe my skills section would be under my about me, but did say it could possibly be under projects also. There were also issues with the scrolling plugin I was using for viewers because reading text at the bottom of the screen and moving it up would cause it to scroll to the next section. They also commented a lot on the aesthetics, liking the minimalism, but thinking the fonts and colors needed work. </p>

					<p> Through my user tests, I found that a lot of people were torn between clicking on "about me" or "projects" to find my skills. A few commented that "seeing what kind of projects he's made would show you what skills he has," which, while sensible, is not what I intended. I also found that some people knew my website was a portfolio right away, while some thought it could be a blog of some sort.

					<h1> Incorporation of Findings </h1>
					<p> I decided to break down my improvements by first fixing the navigational problems. I got rid of the scrolling plugin I used and found a different smooth scrolling plugin. I added a table of contents to my projects page which could be clicked in order to smooth scroll over to a certain project. I find that this fixes the scrolling issues some users had. I also edited "About Me" to say "About Me/Skills" for the sake of clarity. </p>
					
					<p>I also edited the colors for a more professional look. Instead of a bright, light blue, I went with a darker indigo color. I also changed the fonts to give it a more cleaner look. I moved my contact information to its own page so it's more easily navigated to as well. </p>
					
					<p>I didn't really face any challenges coming up with solutions to the problems users faced because they were relatively simple problems. Personally, after using my portfolio, I want to adapt it to a single page portfolio in the future; having to click into different pages takes a small amount of time but it could be better by just being one page. </p>
