            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>
                This project was made in a Udemy course taught by Stephen Grider. This was my first time taking a video course online, and
                I enjoyed Stephen's approach on teaching. I was initially worried because I know that a lot video courses
                online tend to follow a "type this, see what it did?" kind of approach, but Stephen takes his time and purposely
                makes mistakes to teach students common errors and how to resolve them.
            </p>
            <h5>Afterthought</h5>
            <p>
                The development of this project through the course gave me my first dip in the pool of Javascript frameworks. I have a somewhat
                decent understanding of components now, but the development and idea of state and props is still difficult
                for me to implement in personal projects and experiments. For example, creating my first React application,
                a
                <a href="/project-pages/reacttodo-overview.html" class="load link-no-bold">to-do list</a>, I was confused on where to put the state of "tasks" and how to move it down. I feel as if
                this is not due to the course not teaching me correctly, but because it is inherently a difficult subject
                and I'll learn to work with it better with more practice. Taking the first steps with React has been a fun
                experience though, and I can't wait to learn and practice more to see what I can make.
